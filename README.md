# Backend for "Chat App"
- The backend of a web application that runs on browser

## Description<br>
- In this web app users can register, log in, search other users and send/receive private messages.<br>
- My role in this project was to develop the backend for this application as a pair work with my fellow student Mirva.<br>
- I didn't take part in the frontend/UI development - that's why I've included only the backend.<p></p>
<p></p>

## Technologies used<br>
- Programming language: Java<br>
- Spring Framework<br>
- Messaging protocol: STOMP over WebSocket (used to handle 2-way messaging)<br>
- Database access: MariaDB database in a cloud environment<br>
- SHA-256 hashing algorithm for password encryption<br>
<p></p>

## Configuration / running the app<br>
- Run from project root by using command: mvn spring-boot:run<br>
- As application.properties file is not included, database access won't work<br>
