<p></p>
Technologies used<br>
- Programming language: Java<br>
- Framework: Java Spring<br>
- Messaging protocol: STOMP over WebSocet (used to handle 2-way messaging)<br>
- Database access: MariaDB database in a cloud environment<br>
- SHA-256 hashing algorithm for password encryption<br>
<p></p>
Configuration / running the app<br>
- Run from project root by using command: mvn spring-boot:run<br>
- As application.properties file is not included, database access won't work<br>
